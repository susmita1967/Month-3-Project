# Hotel Booking System

This project is a comprehensive hotel booking system that provides RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs for managing hotel bookings. It consists of two separate applications:

1. **PostgreSQL App**: An application built with Express.js and PostgreSQL database using Sequelize ORM. It provides endpoints for managing hotel bookings and implements both RESTful and GraphQL APIs(postgresqlApp.js).

2. **MongoDB App**: Another application built using MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM. It also offers endpoints for hotel booking management, supporting both RESTful and GraphQL APIs(mongoDBApp.js).

## Features
